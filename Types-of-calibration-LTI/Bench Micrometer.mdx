### ***Equipment Template***
1. We created a new ***Equipment Template***.
A POE supermicrometer from bench micrometers will be selected in the Equipment Type option.

### ***Test Code***

o create a Test Code, select the Test Codes option from the main menu, and click 
“New”:
 
• In  this  example,  we  will  create  a  Test  Code  for  Bench  Micrometers 
Supermicrometer POE. In the calibration type field, select the “Bench Micrometers 
Supermicrometer POE”  option.  Then,  enter  the  capacity  ranges  and  the  unit  of 
measure.  Include  also  a  code,  description  and  if  it  is  going  to  be  used  for 
accredited or non accredited calibrations. At the end click “Save”:
4. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (PoE), select the option with the same name in 
the main menu, and click “New”:
 
• Then select the Equipment Template with the model that applies to the new PoE: 
 
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE:  
• Enter the rest of the fields with the PoE information: 
 
• If you want to customize the information entered in the Equipment Template that 
applies for this PoE, you can click “Import tolerance information from ET” if you need 
modify the tolerance, but this step is not necesary because the tolerance is inherited 
from the equipment template:
• Now click on the save button to create the PoE. 
  
5. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (Standard), select the option with the same 
name in the main menu, and click “New”:
 
• Then  select  the  Equipment  Template  with  the  model  that  applies  to  the  new 
Standard: 
 
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE:  
 
• Enter the rest of the fields with the Standard information: 
 
• Then click on the section “Configure Bench Micrometers Standard -Accredited”, here 
you must configure the ranges of the standard values to associate in the wod:
• Then  there  is  the  uncertainty  attributes  section  which,  depending  on  its 
configuration, will define the calculations for said value in the wod, for example:

 
• Now click on the save button to create the Standard. 
  
6. To create a Work Order, select the option with the same name from the main menu, 
and click “New”:
 
• In the new Work Order (WO), select the Customer, Address and Contact: 
 
• Next, a section called “Add PoE to Work Order” should be visible. In there, select the 
respective Test Code that will be applied to this WO to filter the PoEs of that 
customer that applies:
 
• Click on “Select Assets” button. A pop up will be loaded with the different pieces of 
equipment, you can select one or several, then click “Select”:
• A table with the selected PoEs should be displayed, now click “Create Work Order 
Details and Save Work Order” to include the PoEs to this WO in Work Order Details 
(WOD):
 
• A new section called PoE List will be added, including the created WODs: 
 
• After selecting the a WOD, the next step is to configure the “Calibration Instruction” 
section:
 
• After adding all the values, click “Next” to save and continue to the next step “Ready 
for Calibration”: 
 
• In step 2, the standards (Bench Micrometers Standard in this case) can be included 
in the “Standards” section. A pop up will be loaded with the different pieces of 
equipment Standards, you can select one or several, then click “Select”:
 
• Now we can enter to the Calibration section that will include the available tests 
based on the PoE or ET configuration: 
 
• For Anvil Parallelism As Found, the values are entered in this grid: 
 
• For Anvil Parallelism As Left, the values are entered in this grid:
 
• For Anvil Flatness As Found the values are entered in this grid: 
 
• For Anvil Flatness As Left, the values are entered in this grid:
 
• For Magnification Check Meter As Found, the values are entered in this grid: 
 
• For Magnification Check Meter As Left, the values are entered in this grid:
 
• For Tailstock Pressure As Found, the values are entered in this grid, here is posible 
add more test points from button “New” inside the grid:
 
• For Tailstock Pressure As Left, the values are entered in this grid, here is posible add 
more test points from button “New” inside the grid:
 
• For Leadscrew Check As Found, the values are entered in this grid: 
 
• For Leadscrew Check As Left, the values are entered in this grid:
• After that, please enter the equipment conditions: 
 
• And finally, enter the “Environment & Comments” section information:
 
• Now click on the Next button to continue to step 3: 
 
• Here all the information should be in read only mode to the quality check, also you 
can generate the certificate before approving it:


 
 
• Finally, click on “Next: button again to continue to step 4 and finish the order 
workflow:
