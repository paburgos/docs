create a Equipment Template, select the main menu option with the same name:
• Now click “New” and enter the basic information, for this example, a Rockwell 
Hardness Test Block POE will be selected in the Equipment Type option:
• After  having  entered  all  the  basic  information,  the  Tolerance  and  Resolution 
Information option will be presented. There, the tolerance type must be selected 
according to the test. In this case we will choose Resolution, the following options 
will be activated and a resolution number must be added: 
• Now, in the “Other Information” section, a description can be included if needed, 
finally click on the button “Save” to register the Equipment Template in the system:
3. To create a Test Code, select the Test Codes option from the main menu, and click 
“New”:

• In this example, we will create a Test Code for Rockwell Hardness Test Block 
POE. In the calibration type field, select the “Rockwell Hardness Test Block POE” 
option. Then, enter the capacity ranges and the unit of measure. Include also a 
code, description and if it is going to be used for accredited or non accredited 
calibrations. At the end click “Save”:
4. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (PoE), select the option with the same name in 
the main menu, and click “New”:
 
• Then select the Equipment Template with the model that applies to the new PoE:
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE:  
• Enter the rest of the fields with the PoE information:
• If you want to customize the information entered in the Equipment Template that 
applies for this PoE, you can click “Import tolerance information from ET” if you need 
modify the tolerance, but this step is not necesary because the tolerance is inherited 
from the equipment template:
  
• Then you need add the scales rows for the poe, because is necesary for configurate 
in the work order detail on the As Found and As Left grids:


• Now click on the save button to create the PoE. 
5. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (Standard), select the option with the same 
name in the main menu, and click “New”:
 
• Then select the Equipment Template with the model that applies to the new 
Standard:
  
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE: 
• Enter the rest of the fields with the Standard information:
  
• Then click on the section “Configure Rockwell Hardness Test Blocks Standard -
Accredited”:
 
• Within this section you should note that for the Scale field you must enter the value 
configured in the poe with the combination LO, MID or HI like a 10-LO, 10-MID, 10-
HI (you need to create a standard for each combination), an uncertainty value and a 
tolerance for ASTM and ISO, this will be taken in the wod according to the method 
you select, for example:
• Now click on the save button to create the Standard.
6. To create a Work Order, select the option with the same name from the main menu, 
and click “New”:
 
• In the new Work Order (WO), select the Customer, Address and Contact: 
• Next, a section called “Add PoE to Work Order” should be visible. In there, select the 
respective Test Code that will be applied to this WO to filter the PoEs of that 
customer that applies:
 
• Click on “Select Assets” button. A pop up will be loaded with the different pieces of 
equipment, you can select one or several, then click “Select”:
 
• A table with the selected PoEs should be displayed, now click “Create Work Order 
Details and Save Work Order” to include the PoEs to this WO in Work Order Details 
(WOD):
 
• A new section called PoE List will be added, including the created WODs:
  
• After selecting the a WOD, the next step is to configure the “Calibration Instruction” 
section:
 
• After adding all the values, click “Next” to save and continue to the next step “Ready 
for Calibration”:
  
• In step 2, the standards (Rockwell Hardness Test Blocks Standard in this case) can be 
included in the “Rockwell Hardness Testers POE Calibration” section in the Rockwell 
As Found/As Left grids:

• Now we can enter to the Calibration section that will include the available tests 
based on the PoE or ET configuration:
 
• For Rockwell ISO As Found test, the values are entered in this grid:
  
• For Rockwell ISO As Found Environment, the values are entered in this grid:
 
• For Rockwell ISO As Left Environment, the values are entered in this grid:
  
• For Rockwell ISO As Left Environment, the values are entered in this grid:
 
• After that, please enter the equipment conditions:
  
• And finally, enter the “Environment & Comments” section information:
 
• Now click on the Next button to continue to step 3:
  
• Here all the information should be in read only mode to the quality check, also you 
can generate the certificate before approving it: 

• Finally, click on “Next: button again to continue to step 4 and finish the order 
workflow:
