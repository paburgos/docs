create a Equipment Template, select the main menu option with the same name:
 
• Now click “New” and enter the basic information, for this example, a Leeb Tester 
POE will be search in the Equipment Type option:
• After  having  entered  all  the  basic  information,  the  Tolerance  and  Resolution 
Information option will be presented. There, the tolerance type must be selected 
according to the test. In this case we will choose Resolution, the following options 
will be activated and a resolution number must be added:
  
• Now, in the “Other Information” section, a description can be included if needed, 
finally click on the button “Save” to register the Equipment Template in the system:
 
3. To create a Test Code, select the Test Codes option from the main menu, and click 
“New”:
 
• In this example, we will create a Test Code for Leeb Tester POE. In the calibration 
type field, select the “Leeb Tester POE” option. Then, enter the capacity ranges 
and the unit of measure. Include also a code, description and if it is going to be 
used for accredited or non accredited calibrations. At the end click “Save”:
  
4. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (PoE), select the option with the same name in 
the main menu, and click “New”:
• Then select the Equipment Template with the model that applies to the new PoE:
 
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE: 
 
  
• Enter the rest of the fields with the PoE information:
 
• If you want to customize the information entered in the Equipment Template that 
applies for this PoE, you can click “Import tolerance information from ET” if you need 
modify the tolerance, but this step is not necesary because the tolerance is inherited 
from the equipment template:
 
• Now click on the save button to create the PoE.
5. To administrate Pieces Of Equipment (Standard), select the option with the same 
name in the main menu, and click “New”:
• Then  select  the  Equipment  Template  with  the  model  that  applies  to  the  new 
Standard: 
• Then assign the customer that owns this PoE: 
• Enter the rest of the fields with the Standard information: 
• Then click on the section “Leeb Calibration”, in this section you must click on the new 
button to load the fields that are required to be configured in the standard to be 
associated to the grid when configuring the wod, for example:
• The fields scale, value, Tol+/- and Unc.Block must be filled in so that they are 
reflected when loading the wod grids to be configured when associating this 
standard:
 
• Now click on the save button to create the Standard.
6. To create a Work Order, select the option with the same name from the main menu, 
and click “New”:
• In the new Work Order (WO), select the Customer, Address and Contact: 
• Next, a section called “Add PoE to Work Order” should be visible. In there, select the 
respective Test Code that will be applied to this WO to filter the PoEs of that 
customer that applies:
• Click on “Select Assets” button. A pop up will be loaded with the different pieces of 
equipment, you can select one or several, then click “Select”:
  
• A table with the selected PoEs should be displayed, now click “Create Work Order 
Details and Save Work Order” to include the PoEs to this WO in Work Order Details 
(WOD):
• A new section called PoE List will be added, including the created WODs: 
• After selecting the a WOD, the next step is to configure the “Calibration Instruction” 
section:
• After adding all the values, click “Next” to save and continue to the next step “Ready 
for Calibration”: 
• In step 2, in the standards section you must select the corresponding ones to 
generate the test points in the grids, then save so that the system can make the 
corresponding changes, you can also select one more as required:

• Now we can enter to the Calibration section that will include the available tests 
based on the PoE or ET configuration, after saving the selected standards, the 
calibration grids, which are composed of the Leeb As Found and Leeb As Left 
sections, must be configured:
• In the Leeb As Found grid, two test points are generated, which are inherited from 
the previously selected standards, and are configured according to the data to be 
calibrated by the technician:
Also when saving this information, the Detail button can be clicked and the budget 
report will be generated for the uncertainty value of each test point:

• In the Leeb As Left grid, two test points are generated, which are inherited from the 
previously selected standards, and are configured according to the data to be 
calibrated by the technician:
 
Also when saving this information, the Detail button can be clicked and the budget 
report will be generated for the uncertainty value of each test point:

• After that, please enter the equipment conditions: 
• And finally, enter the “Environment & Comments” section information:
• Now click on the Next button to continue to step 3: 
• Here all the information should be in read only mode to the quality check, also you 
can generate the certificate before approving it:


• Finally, click on “Next: button again to continue to step 4 and finish the order 
workflow:
